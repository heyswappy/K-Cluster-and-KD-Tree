# K Dimensional Tree
Python code to implement KDTree.
Search K dimensional space efficiently in O(log(n)) time.

### Features:
1. Create KDTree.
2. Insert nodes dynamically.
3. Delete nodes dynamically.
4. Perform range(rectangle) queries over n dimenesions.
5. Perform radial queries over n dimensions.
6. Find k-nearest neigbours (inefficient).
